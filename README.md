### In this project I have created a binary classifier to predict between cats and dogs using deep learning.The model is trained on around 6200 images of dataset taken from kaggle
### To achieve good accuracy we have used transfer learning techniques.
### I will suggest yout to use google colab gpu for model training as it is less time consuming.After training , the model is saved in tf-lite format to run on android device
### This tf lite model will generate predicitons on your device
##### One important point-try to predict some images using your tf lite model so that you can check whether its working fine or not.
